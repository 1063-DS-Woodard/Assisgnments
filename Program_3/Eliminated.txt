//Program Name: Program 3
//Author: Danny Woodard 
//Description: 
//This program reads in animal names into a doubly-linked
//list, then prompts the user to enter a number that will
//serve as random. The program will
//eliminate a given number of animals from the list. If
//number is even, the pointer moves to the right and if odd
//the pointer moves to the left. Animals are then removed based on the random number
//until one animal is left. This animal is then declared the survivor/Winner.
